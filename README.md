# react-native-css-nitro

`rect-native-css` ported to C++ for performance. This is a prototype and not production ready. Ideally this eventually be `react-native-css@4.0.0`

## Description

This library is a port of `react-native-css` to C++ for performance. It will eventually be a drop in replacement for `react-native-css` and they will share the same compiler.

Unlike `react-native-css`, the majority of the processing is done off thread in C++. When styles are updated they are directly applied to the Shadow Tree nodes.

There are two exceptions where styles are applied via a React re-render:

- A non-style prop is changed (e.g `caretColor`)
- The component is animated (the component has a transition or animation style)

## Progress

These are the features that are "done", in that they pass basic testing. More complex testing is needed to ensure they work in all cases.
